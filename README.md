  "EMERGENT ROBOT TRAITS IN CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS DEPEND ON ENCODING PROPERTIES"<br />

The dataset consists of the behavioural and morphological measures. The experiments consist of changing terrains and repeated for three encodings: <br />

* Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPN) <br />
* Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN) <br />
